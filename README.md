# ReWriteCraft: Text Rewrite with Custom Tone and Dialect 🎨
## Introduction
Welcome to **ReWriteCraft**! 🎉 This project allows you to rewrite your text in a customized tone and dialect using the **LLama 3.1** model. The app provides an intuitive interface to input your draft text and apply different tones (Formal/Informal) and dialects (American/British).

This app leverages LangChain and Ollama models to enhance the AI's rewriting capabilities. Whether you want to refine the tone of a formal letter or add a casual touch to your writing, this app has you covered! 📝
